# Describe the bug

(Describe your issue here).

```
(pg-mem tries to throw nice error messages when possible... so paste it here if you have one !)
```

# To Reproduce

```sql

"If possible, paste here (including create table statements) a query that fails on https://oguimbal.github.io/pg-mem-playground/, but suceeds when ran on an actual PG database"

```


# pg-mem version

(paste your pg-mem version here)

(nb: the version in your package.json version is often not precise enough... please run "cat ./node_modules/pg-mem/package.json | grep version" to tell which minor version is actually installed)
